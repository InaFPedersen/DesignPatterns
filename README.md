# DesignPatterns
A project template with examples.

## Description
A project template with examples of all 23 different Design Patterns, originated from the Gang of Four library of Design Pattern. </br>
The design patterns are split into three categories, behavioral, creational, and structural. </br>
Each of the pattern has its own use cases where it can help optimalize the code.

## Original
The original definitions of the design patterns can be found in the book: </br>
"Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in 1994.

## Tutorial
The tutorial that was followed is made by Kevin Dockx, and can be found at Pluralsight at: </br>
